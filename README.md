# brews

Some scripts to help me deal with brew.  I've found that occasionally
it gets out of date, or breaks in other ways. So my thought is to set
up some scripts to completely uninstall it and then install those casks
that I care about. For now, that list is hard coded in install.sh, but
I may at some point make it more dynamic.

My thinking is that once the uninstall and install scripts are up to
snuff, I can automate the process by writing a reinstall script and
putting it in a monthly cron job.
